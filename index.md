# Welcome to brainramen

Brainramen is a prototype of an app that allows you to learn and practice calculus easily.
It's cool, because:
- You can learn while waiting for a bus or eating breakfast
- It competes for time that would be wasted anyway on useless games or social media interactions
- It doesn't require you to set aside a lot of time
- You don't need pen and paper
- The questions are designed so that you can do all the computation in memory
- Comprehension is one thing, practice is another. This app is meant to help with both.
